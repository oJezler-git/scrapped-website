                "The rosiness of the cheeks refers to vitality, youth and passions (think of blushing when around intimate partners), so the loss of colour demonstrates an aging relationship which is no longer intimate or passionate. A and B are incorrect because the subject of the poem is not dead, as inferred in the opening line “when we two parted / in silence and tears” (i.e. the lovers chose to part ways, rather than one passing away), thus the speaker is referencing the coldness of death to symbolise the death of the relationship itself. D is incorrect because the narrator did not lose passion, it was his lover who pulled away.",

              explanation:
                "Dew is seen in the morning, at the beginning of the day, which subtly sets the narrator as being in new circumstances where he must begin again. A is incorrect as dew is symbolic of life, thus this is more evidence for answer D. B is incorrect because the setting is cold, and C is incorrect because the dew actually juxtaposes the narrator’s sadness (a more suitable setting could be heavy rain or a storm), although it may reflect their tears.",

Although there is a superlative within the poem, this is not a common feature and thus is not trying to create an extremely dramatic effect to the poem, but is solely used to emphasise the finality.

Post World War II, London invited Punjabi residents to take up residency in the UK, advertising better opportunities, but often the families faced discrimination also. Then, in 1962 a ‘Commonwealth Immigrants Act’ was passed, restricting the free movement of workers from the Commonwealth, so most workers in South Asia settled in the UK and invited their families to join them. B is incorrect as these events (India’s colonialisation in 1858 and EIC recruitment) happened around 100 years prior. C is incorrect as India was establishing independence form Britain, which involved civil upheaval and disobedience against Britain’s control in 1947, but the Wandiwash War was in 1760 and established the British Empire in India (not the Commonwealth).",

This juxtaposes their relationship (and perhaps their perspectives on the relationship), as well as their status in the poet’s eyes (he is comparing her to God and something ethereal). Although D is correct, it does not capture the essence of this metaphor, which is to emphasise the love as unrequited, rather than incestuous, but the “disdain” implies that the recipient is above the status of the poet who is perceived as unworthy/inferior.",

                "Harsh weather, “rain”, “sullen wind”, and “storm” foreshadow the murder in Porphyria’s Lover, whilst in Neutral Tones the “grey” setting is used to foreshadow the dead relationship.

Thus, the father is suggesting that the son is moving in a somewhat strange way and without clear purpose or structure, thus highlighting the lack of control and youthful freedom.

              explanation:
                "The river Styx is the first of the five rivers of the underworld in Greek mythology, which formed the boundary between the world of the living and the world of the dead. In the poem, the stream is a metaphor for the separation of the poet from his parents who have passed away, thus is symbolic of the gap between life and death. The stream may also be a symbol for the passing of time.",

              explanation:
                "The unusual separation of the final line from the regular quatrains signifies to the audience that the poet’s relationship with his parents is physically and emotionally separate because of their passing to ‘the other side’.",

                "The poet has stated that Eden Rock is a fictional place (although there is a real Eden Rock in the Caribbean). The name may have been chosen because it is an allusion to The Garden of Eden in the Bible, a perfect place created by God for Adam and Eve, thus reflects the poet’s idealised heavenly place where his parents live on.",

              explanation:
                "Highlighting the minutiae of the memory of his parents’ emphasises their closeness because it implies the poet’s memory is grounded in everyday familiarity and nostalgia. This familiarity with the smaller details is evidence that the poem is based on memories.",

              explanation:
                "Wheat is known as ‘the staff of life’ and represents resurrection in Western civilisation. In the Bible, Jesus says that when a grain of wheat falls to the earth and dies, it is able to produce many more seeds/grains. Hence, wheat is used as a symbol of resurrection. In the poem, Causley’s parents are resurrected in his memory.",

              correctAnswer:
                "This suggests that the poet’s memory is influenced by his mother",
              explanation:
                "Causley’s father died when he was just 7 from injuries pertaining to WWI and he took care of his mother later in his life. It is likely that Causley’s memory of his father is mostly based on photographs of him as a young man, or memories that his mother relayed of his father. Because his father died young, Causley is likely to remember both of his parents together when they were young, based on the stories his mother will have told him. Additionally, as Causley took care of his mother as she grew older and weaker, the image of her as a young woman likely became increasingly nostalgic and poignant for him.",

              explanation:
                "Although all of these answers are examples of the symbolism of light, it can be inferred that in the context of the poem, the light Charles Causley refers to is that of heaven and the spiritual realm. In literature, a ‘bright, white light’ often symbolises Heaven, God, or the afterlife.",

              correctAnswer: "Crossing into the afterlife is not so difficult",
              explanation:
                "The ghostly apparitions are telling Causley that the passing from life to death is not difficult. We can imply this from the allusion to his parents as being on ‘the other side’ (in the afterlife). Answer A may also be correct, although the poem is more thematically focused on the afterlife than on generational misunderstanding. Answer D is incorrect because this is more an interpretation of the final line of the poem.",

              correctAnswer: "Nostalgic",
              explanation:
                "The poem is nostalgic, because it is a wistful recount of an image of his parents from his memory, that implies a yearning for an irrevocable past that is no longer reachable. Although the poem is mourning the loss of his parents, D is not correct as the overall tone because the imagery is happy, creating a more bittersweet than distressing tone.",

              explanation:

                "The poet’s use of indirect address (“they”) and ambiguity, (e.g. “somewhere beyond”), as well as focus on their physical characteristics and possessions and their physical distance across the poet “on the other bank” creates an emotional and physical distance, emphasising the poet’s loss.",

              explanation:
                "Although not explicit, the reference to his parents beckoning for him to join them implies that the narrator is close to death themselves. Many people towards the end of their life see visions of loved ones who have passed, suggesting that the poem is reflective of this phenomenon. This is corroborated by the context of knowing this poem is from Causley’s last poetry collection, although it was published in 1988, long before his death in 2003, hence the distance that is still between himself and his family.",

              explanation:
                "Caesura/enjambment is a break in the middle of a line of poetry, which in this poem is used to symbolise the short flashbacks of her mother in the past, as well as the heartbreak Duffy feels now she is separated from her mother (the poem is published a decade after her death) as well as the disruption the birth of Carol Ann Duffy must have caused in her mother’s previously youthful and fun life.",

              explanation:
                "The noun “relic” accentuates the forgotten yet revered (highly valued) past life of the mother, which was more provocatively vibrant. The mother has kept the item after all this time, suggesting she too regards this past life as important to hold on to despite her new duties as a mother, which ultimately renders the shoes impractical for her new life.",

              explanation:
                "The main purpose of the rhetorical questions is to emphasise the playfulness of her mother’s past through comedic effect. Both questions are sarcastic and wry, juxtaposing the daughters more authoritative approach with her mother’s past brazen behaviour (“whose small bites on your neck, sweetheart?”), effectively swapping the roles of mother and daughter, as well as poking fun at the less desirable responsibilities of a mother (“my loud possessive yell was the best one, eh?”). This also implies that answer A holds weight, but it is incorrect when compared to D. However, answer C is also correct, as Duffy’s mother is lost both physically (she has passed away by the time the poem is written) and metaphorically (her past life has disappeared). This answer is not the strongest of the 4 options as the poem is less about the loss of her mother in the present and more about the loss of her mother’s past life.",
