              explanation:
                "Gerald references his “mother” and “father” on multiple occasions. This could lead the audience to question whether Gerald’s worldview is merely a product of his upbringing and thus he is almost presented as a victim of his society, trapped within his social standing as he is puppeteered by the views of his parents.",

                "Gerald as he questions “I've been trying long enough, haven't I?” Perhaps convincing Sheila to marry him was not as “easy” as his usual social interactions which helps to reinforce the idea that his desire and love for her were there.",
